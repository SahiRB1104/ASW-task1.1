Key elements of test management
What is Test Management?
Test Management is a process that requires proactive managing activities related to the testing of software. It
involves planning, organizing, coordinating, and controlling testing activities for a software development project.

1. Requirement Analysis
Understanding the requirements and establishing clear testing objectives before starting the process.
Risk Analysis: Identifying and assessing potential risks in the project at various levels.
Test Estimation: Determining the effort and resources required for testing.
2. Test Planning
Define the overall testing strategy and approach by understanding project requirements and objectives.
Define Scope and Pre-requisites: Identify test levels like Unit Testing, Integration Testing, System Testing,
etc. Determine testing resources like tools, and environments.
Document a test plan outlining the testing strategy, scope, schedule, and deliverables.
3. Test Design & Development
Create test cases with detailed test steps based on the Test plan. Write Test Scripts for the test cases.
Define Test Scenarios: Identify test scenarios based on the business requirements and specifications.
Create Test Cases: Based on the test scenarios, create test cases that can check the application on different
levels i.e. functional and non-functional.
Write Test Steps: For the given test cases, write detailed and clear test steps that should be followed to run
the test cases. Mention the expected results for each test case and compare actual results to declare a test case
pass or fail.
Write Test Scripts: For automated tests, write test scripts based on the given test cases to run in the selected
test framework such as Selenium, Cypress, Appium.
4. Test Execution
Set up testing environment and execute test cases using prescribed frameworks, tools, and techniques.
Set up Environment: Configure test tools and set up hardware, software, and network configurations.
Execute Test Cases: Run test cases manually or using automated testing tools, record test results and
document any defects found.
Monitor and manage test execution: Ensure faster test execution with Test Case Prioritization, where
crucial tests are run before others.
5. Test Closure
Track defects, consolidate testing activities in Test Execution Report, and find opportunities on continuous
improvement.
Track Defects: Log all the defects, prioritize them as per criticality and track them to resolve defects
efficiently.
Create Test Report: Summarize testing activities in proper reports and evaluate test completion against the
test plan.
Continuous Improvement (Across All Phases)
This final element indicates that testing is iterative.
Each cycle improves tools, processes, standards, documentation, test cases, and execution methods.
Uses techniques like Root Cause Analysis (RCA), metrics analysis, and feedback.
Helps make future testing faster, more efficient, and more accurate.
Explain test organization and structure of testing group.
Short Note on Test Organization
Test Organization refers to the way a software testing team is structured, managed, and coordinated within a project
or company. It defines roles, responsibilities, reporting levels, and workflow, ensuring that testing activities are
performed efficiently and systematically.
A well-organized test structure enables proper planning, control, communication, and independence of the testing
function.
Key Points:
1. Defines Testing Roles
Includes Test Manager, Test Lead, Test Engineers, Junior Testers, Automation/Test Architects.
Clearly specifies responsibilities and authority.
2. Establishes Reporting Structure
Typically a pyramid hierarchy:
Test Manager
Test Leader
Test Engineers
Junior Test Engineers.
Ensures smooth communication and accountability.
3. Supports Independence in Testing
Testers are separated from developers to avoid bias.
Independent testing leads to higher software quality.
4. Allocates Resources and Tools
Test organization manages manpower, test environments, tools, and infrastructure required for testing.
5. Defines Processes and Standards
Establishes uniform test processes, defect reporting procedures, templates, and documentation
standards.
6. Ensures Coordination Between Teams
Acts as a bridge between development, project management, business analysts, and stakeholders.
7. Improves Efficiency and Quality
A structured test organization ensures systematic work, reduces defects, and improves productivity.

Testing Group Hierarchy
Testing Group Hierarchy (Explained with Diagram)
The diagram represents a pyramid structure of the testing organization.
It shows how responsibilities and authority are distributed from top to bottom.
1) Test Manager (Top Level)
The highest authority in the testing group.
Roles & Responsibilities:
1. Defines overall testing strategy and goals.
2. Prepares master test plan and estimates budget, time, and resources.
3. Coordinates with project manager, development manager, business team.
4. Manages high-level risks and resolves escalations.
5. Approves test processes, standards, tools, and training.
6. Reviews test metrics, reports, and ensures quality of testing deliverables.
7. Manages test environment, resource allocation, and release decisions.
8. Provides final approval for Test Summary Report, test closure.
9. Leads continuous improvement of testing processes.
2) Test Leader / Test Lead (Middle Level)
Reports to the Test Manager and acts as the bridge between manager and testers.
Roles & Responsibilities:
1. Converts the test plan into task assignments.
2. Conducts daily stand-up meetings with the test engineers.
3. Prepares detailed schedules for test execution.
4. Allocates work to test engineers based on skill and experience.
5. Reviews test cases, scenarios, scripts prepared by testers.
6. Monitors test progress and defect trends.
7. Coordinates with developers to resolve defects and clarifications.
8. Ensures that test environments and test data are ready.
9. Prepares daily/weekly status reports for the test manager.
3) Test Engineers (Core Execution Level)
These are the main testers responsible for performing testing activities.
Roles & Responsibilities:
1. Write detailed test cases, test scenarios, and test data.
2. Execute test cases manually or through automation tools.
3. Log defects in bug tracking tools (JIRA, Bugzilla, Azure DevOps).
4. Perform retesting and regression testing.
5. Verify requirement coverage through RTM.
6. Identify edge cases and perform exploratory testing.
7. Maintain test logs and update daily progress.
8. Communicate with developers regarding defects and clarifications.
9. Ensure adherence to testing standards and procedures.
4) Junior Test Engineers (Entry Level)
They are new team members with limited experience and usually work under the guidance of test engineers or test
lead.
